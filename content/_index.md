At Jacana, we love technology, but we also know that any sufficiently advanced technology has bugs. Bugs lead to vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities lead to getting hacked.

That's where we come in: we reverse engineer hardware and software, hunt for bugs, and share our work for others to replicate. Our misison is to improve the standards of security for hardware and software by discovering and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities and promoting best practices.
